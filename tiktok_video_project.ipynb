      "Audio transcription content: Welcome to Get This, Not That, where I share the popular products that I love and the ones that I don't. I've got three super greens drinks. This one I don't . I feel I can taste the artificial sweetener. it's really strong. This one has a very mellow flavor. It doesn't taste greens. it's not too sweet. it's kind of drinking a flavored tea. This one, that's good. I can taste the greens, but it's also sweet, but not too sweet. And I kind of being able to taste the greens in this. I feel I'm doing something healthy. And I don't greens. Based on taste alone, I'm going to say Get This, not that. This is a very nice liquid, multi-vitamin that supports hair health. I've taken it off and on over the years when I can afford it, but it's expensive. I don't do that anymore. I take pumpkin seed oil for my hair. Pumpkin seed oil has many benefits. It helps prevent the hair from shedding and promote hair health. it's good for you're heart. it's good for you're bladder and urinary systems. Prostate, if you have one. you're skin, you're eyes. And it's really inexpensive to take this. And of course, I take my vitamin D3 every day because the antioxidant keeps me . And it's also good for you're brain. it's good for you're mood. And fish oil, which is also great for you're heart, great for you're brain. I'm very specific about the supplements I take now. And also, they're much less expensive. Maybe Get This, not that. This lip stain, , the one that goes on purple. it's really hard to get it on precisely. And then you have to leave it on a long time. I put off the purple. And for me, the lip stain was not even. It didn't stay on all day at all. Maybe stayed on a couple hours. it's a pain in the butt. I don't this product. I recently discovered Kulfi lip oil stain. Love this product. It goes on with a glossy oil kind of finish. And when the gloss wears off, it leaves the stain behind. The shiny look is gorgeous. The stain look is gorgeous. And the stain lasts for hours. Can you wipe it off? I have these two colors layered now. This is black cherry and this is rose. These are sleep gummies. And they're made of melatonin. It doesn't work for me. I don't it. It gives me a horrible hangover. These are Lullabytes sleep gummies. They don't have any melatonin. They have a special blend of five ingredients that are all natural. Not habit forming. I fall asleep fast. I stay asleep and I don't have a hangover. I've been taking these for 10 months and I'm a whole new person. Malax and Peel Shot. We got the white rice and the black rice. This one's supposedly stronger than this one. it's going to depend on you're skincare needs and goals. This is a very mild exfoliant compared to what I'm used to. To me, this is very surface level. If you have dead skin, it's probably going to exfoliate you're top layer of dead skin. If you have blackheads, this is great for blackheads. Maybe acne prone skin. I don't know. I think maybe it's targeted to a younger generation because it doesn't have a lot of amino acids or other chemical exfoliants. This is the MetaCube Exosome Shot Treatment 7500 strength. I've been using this for several months and it has completely transformed my skin. Not just at the surface level. It has three amino acids which are powerful chemical exfoliators. It goes deep inside you're skin and exfoliates from within you don't have dead skin. I do not have any dead skin on this face. I use this once a week. Once a week. This has a lot of anti-aging properties and as an older woman, this is better for me with the anti-aging properties. It has helped reduce my dark spots and evened out my skin tone and even helped reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. It has smoothed out my skin. My skin glows. it's bright and it's because of this. I to pair it with the PDRN Collagen Capsule Cream. This duo here once a week at night can completely transform you're skin. I'm not saying this is bad. I'm saying it's not for me. If you're me, get this. And they're we go. Everything I love is going to be linked here in the TikTok shop. Just tap here. I'll see you next time.\n",
